## Mandatory Approval Gate

Use a two-phase workflow when the task includes or could lead to repository edits.

### Phase 1: Review and proposal

- Inspect the relevant files and present findings, recommended changes, affected paths, expected benefits, risks, and concise example patches only where they clarify the proposal.
- Do not edit, create, delete, rename, or overwrite project files during Phase 1.
- Do not run mutating project commands during Phase 1. Read-only inspection/validation is allowed.
- Clearly distinguish required fixes from optional improvements.

At the end of Phase 1, stop and ask exactly:

**Would you like me to go forward and apply these changes?**

Do not apply anything until the user explicitly approves.

### Phase 2: Implementation after approval

Apply only the approved changes. Then run relevant existing PHP syntax/static analysis, lint, tests, and asset build commands when available, fix problems caused by the edits, and report every changed file plus validation results.
